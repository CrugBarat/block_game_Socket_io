# Block Game

A server based 2D block game built using:

**Programming Language**: JavaScript

**Front-end Web Framework**: Vue

**Back-end Web Framework**: Express

**JS libraries**: Socket.io

**Markup/Styling**: HTML5/CSS3

A very VERY basic game grid that uses socket.io for bi-directional communication between server and client. Player position is stored server side. When the player moves the block, the client sends requests to the server, the server changes the position a before sending the data back to the client in real time via socket.io.
